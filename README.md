These website files are from Ch6 of "AWS Projects for Beginners: 21 Real World Projects to Get You Started as an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner" by Femi Reis. The files were downloaded from https://femireis.com/fridge/ (https://femireis.com/Meal_6_Sauteed_S3.zip)

These files will be sent to a AWS codepipeline to create a AWS Docker image and then to run the container through AWS Fargate
